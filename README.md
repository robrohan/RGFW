A cross-platform lightweight single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction library for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. Written in pure C99.

# About
RGFW is a free multi-platform single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction framework for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. it is meant to be used as a very small and flexible alternative library to GLFW. 

The window backend supports XLib (UNIX), Cocoas (MacOS), webASM (emscripten) and WinAPI (tested on windows *XP*, 10 and 11, and reactOS)\
Windows 95 & 98 have also been tested with RGFW, although results are iffy  

Wayland: to compile wayland add (RGFW_WAYLAND=1). Wayland support is very experimental and broken.

The graphics backend supports OpenGL (EGL, software, OSMesa, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, [Metal](https://github.com/RSGL/RGFW-Metal) and software rendering buffers.

RGFW was designed as a backend for RSGL, but it can be used standalone or for other libraries, such as Raylib which uses it as an optional alternative backend.

RGFW is multi-paradigm,\
By default RGFW uses a flexible event system, similar to that of SDL, however you can use callbacks if you prefer that method. 

This library

1) is single header and portable (written in C99 in mind)
2) is very small compared to other libraries
3) only depends on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa
4) lets you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls 

This library does not

1) Handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context)
2) do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality 

# Officially tested Platforms 
- Linux
- Raspberry PI OS
- Windows, (XP, Windows 10, 11, ReactOS)
- MacOS, (10.13, 10.14, 14.5) (x86_64)
- HTML5 (webasm / Emscripten)

# Supported GUI libraries
A list of GUI libraries that can be used with RGFW can be found on the RGFW wiki [here](https://github.com/ColleagueRiley/RGFW/wiki/GUI-libraries-that-can-be-used-with-RGFW)

# examples
![examples](https://github.com/ColleagueRiley/RGFW/blob/main/screenshot.PNG?raw=true)

The examples can also [run in your browser](https://colleagueriley.github.io/RGFW/) with emscripten

## compiling
The examples can be compiled by using `make debug`, which compiles them in debug mode and then runs them\
or `make` which simply compiles them.

The dx11 example has its own Makefile functions because it is Windows only, those include
`make DX11` and `make debugDX11`

You can do CC=`compiler` to specify a specific compiler\
Tested and supported compilers include, `gcc`, `clang`, `[x86_64 / i686-w64]-w64-mingw32-gcc`, `cl` (linux AND windows)

`tcc` has also been tested but work on linux only

## basic 
A basic example can be found in `examples/basic`, it includes a basic OpenGL example of just about all of RGFW's functionalities.

## events 
The event example can be found in `examples/events`, it shows all the events and the data they send.

## callbacks 
The callback example can be found in `examples/callbacks`, it shows all the events and the data they send, but processed with callbacks instead. 

## dx11
`examples/dx11` is a minimalistic example of the use of DirectX with RGFW

## gl33
`examples/gl33` is a minimalistic example of the use of OpenGL 3.3 with RGFW, this example was made by [AICDG](https://github.com/THISISAGOODNAME)

## gles2
`examples/gles2` is a minimalistic example of the use of OpenGL ES 2 with RGFW

## vk10
`examples/vk10` is a minimalistic example of the use of Vulkan with RGFW, this example was made by [AICDG](https://github.com/THISISAGOODNAME)

It also includes `examples/vk10/RGFW_vulkan.h` which can be used to create a basic vulkan context for RGFW.

## basic 
A basic example can be found in `examples/basic`, it includes a basic OpenGL example of just about all of RGFW's functionalities.

## buff
`examples/buffer` is an example that shows how you can use software rendering with RGFW using RGFW_BUFFER mode which allows you to render directly to the window's draw buffer.

## PortableGL
`examples/PortableGL` is an example that shows how you'd use RGFW with `portablegl.h`.

## first person camera
`examples/first-person-camera` is an example that shows how you'd make a game with a first person camera with RGFW

## a very simple example
```c
#define RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "RGFW.h"

u8 icon[4 * 3 * 3] = {0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF,    0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF,     0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF,   0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF,     0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF};

void keyfunc(RGFW_window* win, u32 keycode, char keyName[16], u8 lockState, u8 pressed) {
    printf("this is probably early\n");
}

int main() {
    RGFW_window* win = RGFW_createWindow("name", RGFW_RECT(500, 500, 500, 500), (u64)RGFW_CENTER);

    RGFW_window_setIcon(win, icon, RGFW_AREA(3, 3), 4);
    
    RGFW_setKeyCallback(keyfunc); // you can use callbacks like this if you want 

    i32 running = 1;

    while (running) {
        while (RGFW_window_checkEvent(win)) { // or RGFW_window_checkEvents(); if you only want callbacks
            if (win->event.type == RGFW_quit || RGFW_isPressed(win, RGFW_Escape)) {
                running = 0;
                break;
            }

            if (win->event.type == RGFW_keyPressed) // this is the 'normal' way of handling an event
                printf("This is probably late\n");
        }
        
        glClearColor(0xFF, 0XFF, 0xFF, 0xFF);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        RGFW_window_swapBuffers(win);
    }

    RGFW_window_close(win);
}
```
